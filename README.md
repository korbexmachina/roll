# Roll some dice!

## Overview

Roll is a fast, cross-platform program for rolling dice in your terminal.

It aims to be as intuitive as possible using the same syntax as many tabletop role playing games.

## Usage

```
roll <num>d<sides>
```

### Examples

If you want to roll 3 d20's you can use the following command

```
roll 3d20
```

Or if you want to roll 2 d6's you can use

```
roll 2d6
```

> [!note]
> `roll 1d6` is the same as `roll d6`
